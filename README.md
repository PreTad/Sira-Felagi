# 🌟 Sira-Felagi — Connecting job seekers and employers faster and smarter.

---

## 📖 Project Description
**Sira Felagi** is an **Android-based job portal application** designed to connect job seekers and employers in Ethiopia more efficiently. The app addresses the long-standing challenges of traditional recruitment methods such as word-of-mouth announcements and manual applications, which are often slow, unreliable, and lack transparency. With Sira Felagi, job seekers can easily search for opportunities that match their skills, education, and preferred location, while employers can quickly post vacancies and reach the right candidates without the need for intermediaries.

By offering a simple, fast, and accessible mobile platform, **Sira Felagi** revolutionizes the job search and hiring process. Through features like job browsing, filtering, application submission, and employer job management, the app ensures a smooth digital experience for both parties. This not only saves time and resources but also promotes fairness, visibility, and productivity in Ethiopia’s employment ecosystem.
